abstract: Given a surface S in a 3D contact sub-Riemannian manifold M, we investigate the metric structure induced on S by M, in the sense of length spaces. First, we define a coefficient K at characteristic points that determines locally the characteristic foliation of S. Next, we identify some global conditions for the induced distance to be finite. In particular, we prove that the induced distance is finite for surfaces with the topology of a sphere embedded in a tight coorientable distribution, with isolated characteristic points.
