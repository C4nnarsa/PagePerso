	abstract = {We show that a bilinear control system is approximately controllable if and only if it is controllable in Rn∖{0}. We approach this property by looking at the foliation made by the orbits of the system, and by showing that there does not exist a codimension one foliation in Rn∖{0} with dense leaves that are everywhere transversal to the radial direction. The proposed geometric approach allows to extend the results to homogeneous systems that are angularly controllable.},
